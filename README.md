A fun and whimsical children's book exploring the world of Bitcoin with adorable forest animals.


Edit: Why am I doing this? First, it started as a joke, and the joke became an experiment. This is not a collection of stories for children and not a hacking manual of any kind. It is an exploration of knowledge with LLM and generative AI. If I complete this, I will explain all the details...

For now, this is what I am doing... Over so many years, I had many ideas on how to experiment with finding the dormant addresses for BTC, which hold enormous amounts of money (like treasure chests) that do not belong to anyone. All you have to do is guess the correct number from 1 to 16 64 times! The problem was time, and I could not put any ideas to the test. However, LLM allowed me to do quick scripts in Python, so I made a massive project where every single directory contained code that worked. If I had infinite time, any of those would be able to find the key to a dormant address. So, the idea is to convert each one of those programs to a story for children, not because I want to write stories for children, but because it is an excellent way to build a framework. Each one of those stories was then referenced against the latest research papers. Ultimately, I hope to get some final product based on the research papers. It might end up being something entirely unrelated to cryptocurrencies.
