A fun and whimsical children's book exploring the world of Bitcoin with adorable forest animals.


Edit: Why am I doing this? First, it started as a joke, and the joke became an experiment. This is not a collection of stories for children and not a hacking manual of any kind. It is an exploration of knowledge with LLM and generative AI. If I complete this, I will explain all details...

For now, this is what I am doing... Over so many years, I had many ideas on how I could experiment finding the dormant addresses for BTC, which hold enormous amounts of money (like treasure-chest) that does not belong to anyone. All you have to do is to guess the right number from 1 to 16, 64 times! Problem was time, and I was not able to put any of ideas to test. However, LLM gave me an ability to do quick scripts in Python, so I made a huge project where every single directory contained code that actually works and if I had infinite time, any of those would be able to find the key to a dormant address. So, idea is to convert each one of those programs to a story for children, not because I want to write stories for children, but because it is an excellent way to build a framework. Each one of those stories were then referenced against the latest research papers. At the end, I hope to get some final product, based on the research papers.
